# JsonQL

JsonQL is a REST framework providing different and more effective access to the rest and faster and more cleaner development by using just one endpoint.

Requests can be aggregated to provide "one-trip request" to the server to get all of the necessary data.

All requests are checked using powerful type definitions which can be used to validate request and response data.
These type definitions also for allow generation of REST API automatically.

__NOTE:__ This framework is still a work in progress and is not production ready.
