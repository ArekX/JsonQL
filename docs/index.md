# RestFn

This is a REST framework which only uses one endpoint  
for all of its data needs.

You can get all of the data you need, perform any action and add
authorization and authentication to handle even the most specific
tasks.

## Installation

To start using RestFn in your project you can require it in your
project by calling:

```bash
composer require arekxv/restfn
```
